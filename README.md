AstroQuiz not only tests your cosmic knowledge but also helps you learn interesting facts about our universe. It's a fun and educational experience.

#### Challenge Friends:
Share your quiz score with friends and challenge them to beat your cosmic knowledge.

#### Have Fun:
Most importantly, have fun while learning about the wonders of our universe. AstroQuiz is your ticket to a cosmic adventure!

## Tools and Technologies Used
#### VS Code: 
Visual Studio Code was the primary code editor used for developing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the AstroQuiz application.

#### GitHub: 
GitHub served as the version control and collaboration platform for the project, enabling the team to work on different aspects of the application simultaneously through branching and pull requests.

#### Bootstrap:
Bootstrap played a significant role in shaping the user interface and design of AstroQuiz. It provided pre-designed components, responsive layouts, modals, and styling elements that enhanced the overall look and feel of the application.

#### CDN Fonts: 
Content Delivery Network (CDN) fonts were used to enhance the visual aesthetics of the app by providing a variety of fonts for text elements.

#### Animated-fluent-emoji: 
These animated emojis added a fun and engaging element to the user interface, contributing to the overall user experience.

#### NASA API Images: 
NASA's APIs were integrated into the application to fetch and display stunning images of celestial bodies and planets, creating an immersive visual experience.

#### Le Système Solaire API: 
The Le Système Solaire API was used to access key facts and information about celestial objects within our solar system, enriching the educational aspect of the quiz.

#### Figma: 
Figma was employed as a design and presentation tool to create visually appealing slides and materials for showcasing the project. It allowed for collaborative design work and easy sharing of presentations.

#### Zoom Meetings: 
Zoom meetings were conducted to facilitate team communication and collaboration. They were instrumental in holding remote meetings and discussions throughout the project's development.

#### Google Search Engines and MDN:
Google and MDN were both used to understand how to implement certain codes for what we visualised as a team.

## Challenges Faced 

Despite challenges, our team successfully navigated them by leveraging our skills, collaborating effectively, and prioritising tasks to deliver the AstroQuiz application within the specified timeframe. These experiences served as valuable learning opportunities and demonstrated our team's adaptability and problem-solving capabilities.

#### GitHub Push and Pull to Avoid Conflicts: 
Collaborative development using GitHub introduced challenges related to code conflicts. Coordinating multiple contributors and managing push and pull requests effectively to prevent conflicts demanded careful version control practices and communication.

#### Synchronizing JavaScript Files and working API's testing: 
Coordinating the synchronisation of JavaScript files among team members working remotely was essential to ensure the application's functionality remained consistent. Timely updates and testing were crucial to prevent discrepancies in functionality. To get API's, to test them took a lot of time and hassle when it does not generate what we needed. 

#### Implementing a Progress Bar: 
Creating and implementing a progress bar to track the user's progress as they answer questions correctly and move further away from Earth posed a technical challenge. Ensuring the progress bar accurately represented the distance between celestial bodies required careful coding and testing.

#### Retrieve score and Leaderboard:
It was a challenge to get the score working on the page and local storage to keep the leaderboard. It took us most of the last days before completing the project to get it working.

#### Time Constraints (7 Days): 
The project had a tight deadline of seven days, leaving limited time for planning, development, testing, and deployment. Meeting project milestones and ensuring the application met all requirements within this timeframe was a significant challenge.

#### Remote Collaboration: 
As the team worked remotely, there were challenges related to communication, coordination, and the ability to address issues promptly. Ensuring that everyone was on the same page and maintaining effective communication channels was vital.

Despite these challenges, the team successfully navigated them by leveraging their skills, collaborating effectively, and prioritizing tasks to deliver the AstroQuiz application within the specified timeframe. These experiences served as valuable learning opportunities and demonstrated the team's adaptability and problem-solving capabilities.
